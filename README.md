ViolentPython
=============

A repo where I will upload the codes since I'm reading the book Violent Python
The codes are not exactly as is writed in the book, I modified the examples, trying to improve it,
or just writing whatever I want in that moment.
Cheers and don't be evil ;-)


Chapter 1
=============
An introduction to python with some codes.

[X] Reading.
[X] Code writing.

Codes:

1) VulnerabilityScanner.py --> A simple vulnerability scanner with sockets and banners, the banner vulnerabilities are in a file.

2) UnixPasswordCracker.py  --> A simple unix password cracker (/etc/shadow) with dictionary, just works with an old encription (Python educational purposes)

3) ZipPasswordCracker.py   --> A zip password cracker with threads and parsing the arguments. Uses a dictionary, but with the right dictionary works so nice.


Chapter 2
=============
Penetration testing with Python.

On the way with the two states (read and write at the same time :-P)
[O] Reading.   
[O] Code Writing

Codes:

1)TCPPortScanner.py  --> A simple port scanner using sockets, threads and semaphores (to write in order on screen).

2)nmapPortScanner.py --> A port scanner using nmap library for python.
